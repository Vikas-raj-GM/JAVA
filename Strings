Input Format

The first line contains a string A. The second line contains another string B. The strings are comprised of only lowercase English letters.

Output Format

There are three lines of output:
For the first line, sum the lengths of A and B.
For the second line, write Yes if  A is lexicographically greater than B otherwise print No instead.
For the third line, capitalize the first letter in both  A and B and print them on a single line, separated by a space.

Sample Input 0

hello
java
Sample Output 0

9
No
Hello Java

Explanation 0

String A is "hello" and B is "java".

A has a length of 5, and B has a length of 4; the sum of their lengths is 9.
When sorted alphabetically/lexicographically, "hello" precedes "java"; therefore, A is not greater than B and the answer is No.

When you capitalize the first letter of both A and B and then print them separated by a space, you get "Hello Java".

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String A = sc.next();
        String B = sc.next();
        System.out.println(A.length() + B.length());
        
        int v = A.compareTo(B);
        if(v>0)
        {
          System.out.println("Yes");
        }
        else if(v<0)
        {
          System.out.println("No");
        }
        
        System.out.println(A.substring(0,1).toUpperCase()+A.substring(1) +" "+ B.substring(0,1).toUpperCase()+B.substring(1));
    }
}
